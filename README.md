# E-Commerce Revenue Prediction with Tree Ensemble Machine Learning Models

Tyler Kinkade

In this supervised machine learning project, I compared the effectiveness of the random forest and gradient boosting ensemble tree models in predicting the probability of making a purchase on an e-commerce website based on users' interactions with the site. I also examined differences in feature importance between the two models.

See the [project.ipynb](https://github.com/tyknkd/e-commerce-revenue-prediction/project.ipynb) Jupyter notebook for the full report.
